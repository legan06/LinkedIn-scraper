Uçak, rüzgarı karşısına alarak yükselir, arkasına alarak değil.” 
Henry Ford

Bugüne kadar okuduğum en güzel cümlelerden biri. Tabi ki Pınar eklemesi yapmadan geçemem:

Rüzgarı karşımıza aldığımızda havalanmamızı sağlayan şey, arkaya değil, önümüze bakmak..

Ve yerdeki fren izlerimizi değil; gökyüzünü görmeye odaklanmak 🛫",16h

During the past 2 years, American University has been trying to find ways to celebrate the accomplishments of 2020, & 2021 graduates. This past month we were able to hear our names called as we walked across the stage for this milestone in our lives!! There were thousands of 2020 graduates who did not get the privilege to walk. This speaks volumes for this great institution, not only does it pour knowledge into inquisitive minds along with adding value to your network, but they are just as excited as my classmates and I to celebrate this next chapter in our lives!! Thank AU!!
